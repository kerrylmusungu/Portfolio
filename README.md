## US Citizen| DoD Security Clearance:Secret  

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a data enthusiast with a passion for uncovering insights, solving complex problems, and driving data-driven decision-making. With expertise in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Machine Learning, I leverage data to tell compelling stories and deliver actionable solutions.

STEM graduate with a master‚Äôs degree in data science (GPA 3.6) and a bachelor‚Äôs degree in mathematics and computer science,
providing a solid foundation in business analytics, statistical modeling, and systems analysis. With over three years of experience
working with Python for data science projects. Have a proven track record in model development, verification, and validation, and a
passion for leveraging natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and text mining techniques to extract actionable insights. I
am proficient in Python for data manipulation, cleaning, and quality improvement, as well as SQL for database management and
optimization. I have hands-on experience in applying advanced data mining techniques, deep learning frameworks, and NLP models
to enhance decision-making and predictive analytics. My expertise extends to statistical sampling, data visualization (Tableau, Power
BI), and managing classified data with attention to detail and compliance. My four years in the U.S. Army, where I managed assets
worth over $5 million, further honed my skills in maintaining procedural accuracy, adherence to security protocols, and effective
communication at all levels. Additionally, I possess over a decade of experience with Microsoft Excel.
